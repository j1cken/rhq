/**
 * A class that can be used by plugins whose components may not be able to collect availability statuses fast enough.
 * 
 * Typically, availability checks are very fast (sub-second). However, the plugin container puts a time limit
 * on how long it will wait for a plugin's resource component to return availability status from calls to
 * {@link AvailabilityFacet#getAvailability()}. This time limit is typically on the order of several seconds.
 * The purpose of this time limit is to avoid having a rogue or misbehaving plugin from causing delays in availability
 * reporting for the rest of the resources being managed within the system.
 * 
 * This class provides an implementation to help resource components that can't guarantee how fast its
 * availability checks will be. Some managed resources simply can't respond to availability checks fast enough. In this
 * case, this class will provide an asynchronous method that will collect availability without a timeout being involved
 * (in other words, availability will be retrieved by waiting as long as it takes). In order to tell the plugin container
 * what the managed resource's current availability is, this class will provide a fast method to return the last known
 * availability of the resource. In other words, it will be able to return the last know availability that was last retrieved
 * by the asynchronous task - this retrieval of the last known availability will be very fast.
