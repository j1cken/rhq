/*
 * @PluralText takes an array of strings.  The even indexes represent plural form names, while the odd indexes
 * correspond to the text for the associated plural form.  Example:
 * 
 *    @PluralText( { "one", "There is a single item in your cart.",
 *                   "two", "There are two items in your cart.",
 *                   "few", "There are a few items in your cart.",
 *                   "many", "There are many items in your cart." } )
 *
 * As of GWT 2.0.4, the following plural forms exist:
 * 
 *    none  one     two   eighteleven
 *    few   paucal  many  other
 * 
 * However, not all of them are applicable to each locale.  When implementing a new localization, refer to the
 * appropriate subclass of "com.google.gwt.i18n.client.impl.plurals.DefaultRule" to obtain the necessary plural
 * form subset which must be implemented to correctly support that locale.
 * 
 * The rules implemented in these various subclasses are taken from:
 * 
 *    http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/l10n/pluralforms
